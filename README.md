# Bookstore Web Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack bookstore web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application features dynamic and responsive design, providing a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for Node.js.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Frontend**: Contains the React.js application and UI design implemented with Tailwind CSS.
2. **Backend**: Contains the Express.js server and MongoDB configuration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- MongoDB (locally or a cloud instance)
- Git (optional, for version control)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**:

   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
   
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the development server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Backend Setup**:

   - Navigate to the backend directory:

     ```bash
     cd ../backend
     ```

   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Configure your MongoDB connection in the `config.js` file or as environment variables.

   - Start the server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

- **Frontend**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React.js application.
- **Backend**: The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.
